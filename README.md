# üß† TxBrain Engine (R&D)

> AI-powered self-healing system for autonomous error detection, diagnosis, and recovery.

TxBrain Engine is an adaptive self-repair AI designed to detect, analyze, and automatically fix system-level errors.  
It integrates with **Shelter Server** and optionally connects to **Gemini AI** for LLM-based repair reasoning.

üî¨ **Research & Development Project** ‚Äî part of the AI Shelter / TxBooster ecosystem.

## üß© Core Concepts
- **Self-Healing Automation**: Learns from errors, executes verified fixes automatically.  
- **Adaptive AI**: Expands its knowledge base dynamically through heuristic & LLM learning.  
- **Sandbox Verification**: Tests every fix in a virtual environment before applying.  
- **Knowledge Synchronization**: Syncs with Shelter Server via REST API.  
- **Autonomous Memory Evolution**: Maintains local `knowledge.db` for persistent reasoning.

---

## üîß Technical Overview
- Written in Python 3.10+
- Includes integrated Flask dashboard (`localhost:8899`)
- Uses SQLite for local knowledge memory
- Supports Gemini AI integration via API key
- Modular design ‚Äî can operate offline or in networked environments
