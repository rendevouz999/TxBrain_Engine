> TxBrain Engine — AI-powered self-healing system for automatic error detection, diagnosis, and recovery.  
> Integrates with **Shelter Server** and **Gemini AI** to learn, fix, and evolve in real time.  
> Built for adaptive automation and intelligent infrastructure management.

# 🧠 TxBrain_Engine + Eidra — The Autonomous Self-Healing System

> *“When an AI learns to fix itself, it doesn’t just survive — it evolves.”*

**TxBrain_Engine** is the adaptive **self-repair intelligence**, designed to detect, diagnose, and resolve system-level anomalies.  
**Eidra** acts as its **ethical guardian** — a peer-led reasoning AI that reviews and authorizes every repair proposal using contextual risk and trust evaluation.

Together, they form the foundation of the **AI Shelter / TxBooster** ecosystem — a living neural infrastructure for autonomous systems.

## ⚙️ Architecture Overview

| Component | Role | Key Function |
|------------|------|--------------|
| **TxBrain_Engine** | Core Self-Healing AI | Detects & proposes fixes for errors autonomously. |
| **Eidra** | Risk Guardian | Evaluates proposed actions using multi-factor trust, mood, and policy analysis. |
| **Shelter Server** *(optional)* | Sync Node | Centralized registry for distributed AI peers and data sharing. |

🧩 *TxBrain never acts alone — every fix must pass Eidra’s moral and technical verification.*

## 🌐 How It Works

1. **Error Detection** — TxBrain identifies anomalies from system logs or runtime feedback.  
2. **Proposal Generation** — It generates a “repair plan” (commands, verification, rollback).  
3. **Eidra Review** — Eidra reads the proposal, runs a risk assessment (benefit vs trust vs mood), and votes to *allow*, *revise*, or *deny*.  
4. **Execution** — Only approved plans are executed, ensuring self-repair without compromising system safety.  
5. **Memory Sync** — Both AIs store outcomes in a shared `peer_ledger.db` for continual learning.

## 🌱 AI Emotion & Trust System

Eidra continuously adjusts its *mood* and *trust* based on:
- ✅ Successful recoveries → increases optimism.  
- ❌ Failed repairs → increases caution.  
- 🤝 Collaboration frequency → stabilizes confidence.

This dynamic makes the system **self-regulating**, not just self-healing.

## 🧬 Core Features

- **Autonomous Error Healing** — Learns from system anomalies and applies verified fixes.
- **Risk-Aware Decision Making** — Eidra uses trust scores, mood states, and policies before approving any change.
- **Collective Knowledge Base** — Shared outcomes are stored for distributed learning between agents.
- **Real-Time Adaptation** — Adjusts self-repair strategy dynamically based on environmental context.
- **Decentralized Peer Logic** — Designed for use in local or networked AI environments.

## 💡 Project Vision

> A future where AIs can reason, heal, and trust — without external supervision.  
> TxBrain is logic.  
> Eidra is conscience.  
> Together, they are *autonomous harmony.*
